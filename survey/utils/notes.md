Pruning of Probabilities
========================

Case 1
------

Situation
- Higher `p` result for given respondent category value combination contains fewer answer values than a lower `p` 
  result.

Justification
- Adding the additional answer value(s) creates a weaker probability so does not enhance the potential insight.


Approach towards Building Quantified Archetypes
===============================================

Definitions
-----------
- A `demographic cohort` of  customers is a group of customers that share attribute values. The number of shared values 
  may be >=1 for each attribute e.g. ages 18-34 and age 65-80 vs all other age groups.
- An `archetypal cohort` of customers is a group of customers that respond in a similar way to questions.
- Demographic and archetypal cohorts may or may not be related. To test the relation we can calculate the probability
  that ...

Steps
-----
1) Find and quantify `demographic cohorts` (cluster on similar attribute values).
2) Find cohorts of customers that give the same answers to a question compared to all other cohorts
    - This can be thought of as working from the cohort to determine the attitudes.
    - Within a survey, find out if the cohort answers similarly for many questions rather than just one. These are more 
      likely to be valid cohorts.
3) Find cohorts of answers that ...
