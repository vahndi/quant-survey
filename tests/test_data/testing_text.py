    'But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing '

    ' of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of'
    ' the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, '
    'dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because '
    'those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter '
    'consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who '
    'loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, '
    'but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can '
    'procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us '
    'ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some '
    'advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who '
    'chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who '
    'avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we '
    'denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled '

    'desire, that they cannot foresee'
